Sure it wouldn’t seem like much fun to visit a spooklight area in the daytime, but scouting a location before dark is an important part of research.  Topography can fool you at night.  GPS waymarks, altitude readings, and compass bearings done on site are always more accurate than the computer generated version.  Plus, daytime scouting gives a real feel for the lay of the land and helps identify any possible artificial light sources before night fall.    The first thing you notice as you arrive at the Spooklight road is that unlike the old pictures there is a nice layer of blacktop.  Several correspondents have assured me that the new road surface has not effected the appearance of the Hornet light as road work has with other ghost lights.  The ditches are deep.  It would not pay to pull too far off the shoulder here.  While good for drainage, its bad for paranormal tourism.  I doubt Ottawa county cares, anyway.  The people who built the nice new houses along the Devil’s Promenade are reputed to dislike light hunters and hate the nocturnal traffic the Spooklight brings. Which begs the question. Why buy property on a public road and then complain about the public?  It’s especially ludicrous since the Spooklight has drawn paranormal thrill seekers for more than a hundred years.  Who would build a house in a known and popular sighting area if they didn’t like the attention the phenomenon brings?  That’s like building next to an elementary school and demanding that the children keep it quiet during recess. But not all the residents along Spooklight Road are inhospitable. One trotted right up to us as we took readings and pictures near the site of Spooky Middleton’s old museum.    He Bit a big chunk out of the plants Mrs. Austen had just bought on sale at Home Repo in Joplin, gave us a nod, and headed toward home.    We had little time to visit and unfortunately couldn’t wait for dark.  On the way back to the main drag toward Fayetteville, we saw something that caused us to back up and snatch a few more pictures.  It just may be me, but in South Arkansas we just don’t have that many submarines, especially submarines mounted on poles.      Due to all the bullet holes, I’m sure it will submerge.  Surfacing is the question.  You can see just about anything around Hornet.  And it gets stranger after dark. We shall return.

More than a hundred people were injured in that twister.  The storm destroyed more than forty homes and businesses.  Only three houses escaped major damage.  Fortunately, one house that survived was a three-story home on the edge of town belonging to Dr. Elias A. Rowan.  Like most country doctor’s homes in those days, Dr. Rowan’s house also served as the hospital for the community.  He took in the bulk of the injured.  Despite Dr. Rowan’s tireless efforts to lessen the victims suffering, eleven still died from the Beauregard tornado of 1883. The town’s residents never forgot Dr. Rowan’s efforts.  He remained respected as a member of the community, not only as town doctor, but for his work with the church and charity.  Dr. Rowan lived an active life and continued his practice long after most would have retired. One night in 1912, an elderly Dr. Rowan ventured across the Illinois-Central tracks toward the Beauregard Station to meet a patient returning from a procedure done at a large city hospital.  The doctor didn’t notice the approaching train until it was too late.  The engineer saw the frantically waving lantern, but could do little to stop in time.  Beauregard lost its best-loved citizen to dismemberment below the oncoming train’s screeching wheels.  Dr. Rowan’s death became just one more tragedy to befall a seemingly cursed town. Though respected and loved for all his days, it appears Dr. Rowan failed to find rest in the afterlife.  The old house beside the tracks soon gained a reputation for paranormal activity.  Reports of strange sounds, unexplained lights, and ghostly apparitions centered on Dr. Rowan’s house kept the townspeople away.  For many years, the house remained much as its owner left it and no one went inside to plunder Dr. Rowan’s belongings or investigate the baffling occurrences.  Thus, it was no surprise to locals when train crews first reported the mysterious light on the tracks.     (c)2015 Thornton Austen    It was in 1926 that a train first braked to a stop for someone frantically waving a lantern in Beauregard and upon investigation found no one there.  When the train reached McComb, the crew reported the incident to the yard boss, who laughed it off.  The same thing happened the next night.  The light soon became a regular occurrence and the town of Beauregard became known as “Flag Stop” among local railroaders.  The yard boss kept careful records of the stoppages at Beauregard, but feared the ridicule of his superiors.  It was some time before he reported the incidents.  When he finally took his logbooks in there was no laughter.  The railroad assumed the light was an act of sabotage perpetrated by union agitators.  They immediately called in railroad detectives to investigate. The detectives did a thorough investigation and questioned everyone who had witnessed the light.  Before long, the investigators had an exact location pinpointed and began a stakeout.  Their target was a stretch of tracks where the light always appeared.  It happened to be adjacent to Dr. Rowan’s abandoned house.  Finding no other possible source for the light, they concluded Dr. Rowan’s ghost was responsible for the incidents.  The case was closed. Trains continued to stop for the phantom lantern of Beauregard for many years afterward.  The railroad lived with the nuisance.  Eventually, light activity dwindled after new landowners demolished Dr. Rowan’s house in the late 1940’s.  However, there are still reports of an occasional sighting of Dr. Rowan’s lantern near the site of his old home on the south edge of town. Today, little remains of the town of Beauregard.  Economics has accomplished what Mother Nature failed to destroy.  To get there off I-55 north of Brookhaven take Wesson exit 51.  The remains of Beauregard lie on US Highway 51.  Freight and passenger trains still use the tracks and travel at high speeds around the blind curve in town.  I strongly urge light hunters to stay off the tracks as a train can come on them unexpectedly just as it surprised Dr. Rowan.  No one wants you to add your ghost to the Illinois-Central legend.

It’s hard to post one of my short stories on the blog.  Most average around 3,000 words.  That makes for a long column.  This year I will make an exception to the rule.  A while back I toyed some with flash fiction.  As a former copy writer I’m used to packing the most wallop into the shortest possible space.  Rules dictated that the following tale is a mere 99 words, not counting the title.  It won the Saturday Fiction Writers’ Award a couple of years back and MicroHorror subsequently published it.  I hope you enjoy fiction done fast.    LOVE AND THE INNER BEAST   I never smelled a girl like her in Safeway.  She pushed a buggy down the cereal aisle and turned her cheek to hide the striped claw mark that makeup couldn’t.  I knew the lacy blouse hid more scars like the crescent on my cheek a pup gave me as a child.  As I sacked her groceries, my heart sank –-  Cat food.  Large brown eyes showed the felines were just a snack.  “Beautiful moon tonight,” I said, “Feel like a howl?”  Her pupils narrowed to slits.  She smiled as her nostrils tasted me.  “Sure.”  Finally.  My kind of girl.

Gef - The Eighth Wonder of the World
.W
                                                                Gef: The Eighth Wonder of the World     Who was Gef the Talking Mongoose? And what did he talk about?                                                                                                  The Story of Gef        Gef News: 2017 sees the release of  Christopher Josiffe's book about Gef . See also  Christopher's Blog . C      "That aint me! Looks more like a llama!" retorted Gef when shown this  sketch drawn from witness descriptions of him    "If you knew what I know, you'd know a hell of a lot!" boasted Gef the Talking Mongoose, the miraculous mammal claimed to haunt the Isle of Man during the early 1930s.  But who, or what, was Gef himself? A poltergeist? A cryptid? Or no more than a bizarre Folie à Deux created by a lonely adolescent girl and her father?  Nearly a century later, the tale still fascinates and frustrates researchers and remains unique in the annals of Fortean phenomena.    Doarlish Cashen   The strange saga of Gef the talking mongoose began in Autumn 1931 in an isolated hilltop farmstead on the Isle of Man known as Doarlish Cashen (Manx for 'Cashen's Gap'). The farm was home to 60-yr-old Jim Irving, his wife Margaret, and their 12-yr old daughter Voirrey.    Doarlish Cashen   Jim had been a travelling salesman before taking up farming in his retirement. The farm was not a success. Productivity was dropping and the family struggled to make ends meet. They had no electricity, no phone and no radio. Their nearest neighbours lived over a mile away.   The Thing in the Walls One dull September evening, the family heard inexplicable "blowing, spitting and growling" sounds coming from behind the wooden paneling lining the farmhouse walls. Jim thought a rat was to blame and tried in vain to drive it from its lair.  The strange noises persisted over the following days. Jim set traps and laid down poison but to no avail. In desperation he even tried to flush the intruder out by growling like a dog. To his surprise, it growled right back at him. The elusive creature proved to be a talented mimic. It ingratiated itself with Jim by repeating his imitations of various animals and birds. Soon he had only to name an animal and it would promptly respond with the appropriate imitation. At other times it made a gurgling sound like a baby attempting to form its first words. Then it began to talk...   Gef Introduces Himself      Voirrey, Margaret and Jim Irving  By way of experiment Voirrey asked the creature to repeat some nursery rhymes. It obliged in a clear, if very squeaky, voice. Soon it was speaking freely. It introduced itself as Gef (pronounced 'Jeff') and claimed to be "an extra clever mongoose" born in Delhi, India in 1852. (A neighbouring farmer had actually imported Mongeese to the island 20 years earlier, hoping to curb the local rabbit population.)  Gef was soon holding regular conversations with both Voirrey and her father, though he seemed less friendly towards Voirrey's mother, Margaret.  He began nesting in a boxed partition in Voirrey's room, which the family dubbed "Gef's sanctum".  Although Jim and Margaret both caught brief glimpses of Gef, only Voirrey was allowed to look at him directly. She described him as being the size of a small rat, with yellowish fur, a flat snout like a hedgehog, and a long bushy tail.   Gef's Habits Gef soon became one of the family. During the day he would roam the island riding on the back axles of buses and cars. In the evening he would return home to share news and gossip he had picked up on his travels. Sometimes he would also read out items from the local newspapers. When he grew tired of chat, he would call out 'Vanished!' and make himself scarce.     Gef's Sanctum  "It announces its presence by calling either myself or my wife by our Christian names," Jim Irving wrote. "It's hearing powers are phenomenal. It is no use whispering. It detects the whisper 15-20 feet away, tells you that you are whispering, and repeats exactly what one has said."  Gef would often bring rabbits home for Margaret to cook, that he apparently strangled with his forepaws. In return he was given tidbits such as biscuits, sweets and chocolate. He was also fond of bacon and sausages. The food would be left out for him on the crossbeams near the ceiling, and he would sneak out and snatch it when no-one was looking.   Singalong with Gef Gef enjoyed singing as much as talking. His favourite tune was Carolina Moon, which he would croon along to the gramophone. (Sometimes he would bounce a rubber ball up and down in time to the music instead.) He could also sing the Manx national anthem, several hymns and some fragments of a Spanish folksong.  On one occasion he rather offended Voirrey's mother by singing a lewd parody of Home on the Range he had picked up from some bus drivers. "You know Gef, you are no animal!" scolded Margaret. "Of course I am not," retorted Gef. "I am the Holy Ghost!"   Gef's Temper Like many a poltergeist (or adolescent girl) Gef had a short fuse. For example, he once suddenly flew into a rage when he thought Jim was taking too long opening the morning post. "Read it out, you fat-headed gnome!" he squeaked furiously.  Voirrey seems to have been rather afraid of Gef when he first manifested, one night even sleeping in her parent's bedroom to avoid being alone in the dark with the inhuman noises. "I'll follow her wherever you put her," Gef snapped when he overheard the family discussing this. According to Jim, barricading the bedroom door with chairs and boxes only infuriated Gef further:  "Soon we saw the top of the door bulging in as though some terrific force were thrusting against it. But the door held. Then Gef's queer high voice said 'I'm coming in!' A few seconds later a heavy pot of ointment kept in the room crashed against the bedstead." Gef seemed to hugely enjoy deliberately provoking Voirrey's parents. One night he made a nuisance of himself by sighing and groaning loudly for 30 minutes without pause, before confessing, "I did it for devilment!"  On another occasion Margaret found herself being pelted with stones as she walked home. "Is that you, Gef?" she called out. "Yes, Maggie the witch woman, the Zulu Woman, the Honolulu woman!" taunted the impertinent mongoose. Gef also delighted in throwing pebbles and sand up at the windows from outside, sometimes late into the night.   Gef's Fame    Voirrey and Jim Irving with Richard Lambert  The Manx papers ran a series of gently mocking articles about the 'Dalby Spook' (as they dubbed Gef) which led to Voirrey being teased mercilessly at school. Gef's fame spread to the mainland after Jim Irving persuaded the psychic researcher (and inveterate self-publicist) Harry Price to take an interest in the case.  But even as Gef's notoriety grew, his visits to the Irvings became fewer and farther between. By the time Price arrived to investigate in person, the marvellous mongoose was conspicuous only by his absence. (See Investigating Gef Pt 2. )  In 1936, Price published the results of his investigation in The Haunting of Cashen's Gap: A Modern "Miracle" Investigated, a slim book co-authored with journalist Richard Lambert. Although Price did not explicitly accuse the Irvings of perpetrating a hoax, neither did he validate their claims.   Farewell to Gef Soon after Price's book was published, the Irvings left Cashen's Gap for the mainland. Gef did not follow them there nor did he introduce himself to the new owner, a Mr Graham.  Intriguingly, in 1947 Graham trapped and killed a strange looking animal that seemed to be neither ferret, stoat nor weasel. "It answers to all descriptions," the puzzled farmer told the local press. Eventually Graham too left Cashen's Gap, and the farmhouse was demolished.  In 1970 a reporter from FATE magazine managed to track Voirrey down to interview her about her strange childhood experiences. She proved reluctant to discuss her former life with Gef. "Yes, there was a little animal who talked and did all those other things," she admitted. "He said he was a mongoose and we should call him Gef... But I do wish he had let us alone."

No estoy asustando sino previniendo, porque tengo angustia por esta pobre Humanidad, ya que los hechos no se hacen esperar y no hay tiempo que perder en cosas ilusorias. - V.M. Rabolú    Clic aquí               En todos los rincones del mundo encontramos tradiciones y relatos proféticos, todos ellos con gran parecido y que hacen referencia a los tiempos finales.  La gran mayoría de esos vaticinios nos alertan de grandes catástrofes en la Tierra, tales como un inminente cambio en el eje de nuestro planeta, el consiguiente deshielo de los polos y la desaparición de grandes zonas de tierra firme debido a fuertes terremotos y tsunamis.  Existen muchas profecías que tienen algo en común: hablan concretamente del acercamiento de un gran planeta que nos visita de forma periódica. Este planeta habría llegado a nuestro sistema solar en anteriores ocasiones para desencadenar cataclismos que hicieron desaparecer las civilizaciones de la Lemuria y de la Atlántida. Ahora llegaría para terminar con nuestra civilización actual y así dar lugar a una nueva era.  Conocido en muchas tradiciones, profecías y libros sagrados, se le han dado diferentes nombres tales como: Baal, Planeta Frío, Planeta Rojo, Wormwood, Ajenjo, Hercólubus, Barnard I y otros más. Este planeta estaría ya al alcance de los telescopios y su tamaño sería de unas seis veces el de Júpiter.  Como quiera que en el vaivén de la vida todo retorna a su principio o a su fin, ya sucedió que en su anterior acercamiento Hercólubus puso fin a la civilización Atlante. Estos hechos quedaron debidamente narrados a través de todos los “Diluvios Universales” de diferentes religiones y culturas.  Muchas personas han hablado sobre tal fenómeno cósmico. Una de ellas fue V.M. Rabolú, quien investigó sobre el acercamiento de tal astro haciendo uso de las facultades de la conciencia despierta, las cuales le permitieron investigar sobre el acercamiento de tal astro. De su obra titulada “Hercólubus o Planeta Rojo”, que la asociación Alcione envía gratuitamente a todos los países del mundo, entresacamos los siguientes párrafos:  “Cuando Hercólubus se acerque más a la Tierra, que se ponga a la par del Sol, empezarán las epidemias mortíferas a expandirse por todo el planeta y los médicos o ciencia oficial no conocerán qué clase de enfermedades son y con qué se curan; quedarán manos arriba ante las epidemias.”  “Llegará el momento de la tragedia, de la oscuridad: temblores, terremotos, maremotos. Los seres humanos se desequilibrarán mentalmente por no poder comer ni dormir; y viendo el peligro, al precipicio se lanzarán en masas, locos totalmente.” V.M. Rabolú  V.M. Rabolú, el gran esoterista colombiano, alzó su voz para alertar a la humanidad sobre esta amenaza y subraya que la misma es real y que podría suponer el final de nuestra civilización y de nuestra cultura. En su libro enseña el método de eliminación de los defectos psicológicos y las técnicas para el desdoblamiento astral como únicas fórmulas existentes para salvarse del cataclismo que viene.  V.M. Rabolú concluye su obra diciendo:  “Amable lector: estoy hablando muy claro para que entienda la necesidad que hay de lanzarse a trabajar seriamente, porque el que esté trabajando se saca del peligro. Esto no es para que lo formen teorías ni discusiones, sino para que experimenten la verdadera enseñanza que les estoy dando en este libro, pues no nos queda más a qué apelar.”  Asociación Alcione  Organización sin ánimo de lucro, designada Agente-Colaborador en la difusión y distribución de la Obra “Hercólubus o Planeta Rojo”.  Editor: Ángel Prats Autor: Joaquín Amórtegui Valbuena (V.M. Rabolú)  La Asociación Alcione se encuentra inscrita en el Registro Nacional de Asociaciones del Ministerio de Interior, grupo 1 sección 1, con el número nacional 588698, y tiene su sede en la Paseo de los Pisones nº 6 – esc.2 – 6º C de la ciudad de Burgos (España).  Sobre el autor  V.M. Rabolú (1926 – 2000)  V.M. Rabolú (1926 – 2000) nació en Tolima (Colombia). En 1952 encuentra el verdadero Conocimiento y mediante largos años de prácticas esotéricas llega a desarrollar extraordinarias capacidades que le convierten en un guía espiritual de renombre mundial  Conocedor del futuro que nos aguarda, siempre estuvo dedicado a enseñar a la humanidad las fórmulas para su propia regeneración espiritual. Así, a partir de los años 70, y siempre de forma altruista y desinteresada, comienza una infatigable labor de divulgación pública de la verdadera Sabiduría en el ámbito internacional mediante conferencias, cursos, congresos, etc.  En el año 1998 escribe “Hercólubus o Planeta rojo”. Basándose en su experiencia directa y consciente, V.M. Rabolú describe los terribles acontecimientos que sucederán en nuestro planeta a corto plazo y muestra el camino a seguir para lograr la transformación profunda del ser humano. Hoy día las afirmaciones contenidas en dicha obra cuentan con el reconocimiento de multitud de lectores que se han beneficiado de estos conocimientos en más de 80 países.  “No soy un metemiedos, soy un ser humano que estoy advirtiendo lo que viene y lo que va a pasar”. V.M. Rabolú  V.M. Rabolú fue una de esas escasas personas de Conciencia Despierta y sus enseñanzas se hacen imprescindibles en estos tiempos en los que el materialismo y la escasez de valores se han convertido en los signos distintivos de una sociedad cada vez mas perdida.  Mantras  En la presente sección, pueden escuchar a V.M. Rabolú pronunciando los mantras para el desdoblamiento astral, de modo que puedan conocer su correcta pronunciación.

Articles presented in the spirituality sections are written based on an overwhelming or unanimous belief that said artifacts do exist, somewhere in the world. Exact details on a scientific level remain mostly unknown or enshrouded in secrecy. Scientific or religious subjects do face scrutiny on a regular basis and a definitive interpretation is usually placed on reader trust. We understand fringe topics in alternative sciences are controversial, and in these realizations, a cautiously optimistic approach is necessary and recommended. Parental guidance is suggested for visitors under 13, and all controversial articles are clearly marked with a † indicator.  The universe, we understand is largely unknown, and it is capable of constantly surprising our realities in new ways. It is for certain, we may find answers by asking the right questions and exploring alternative realms of possibility. The sense of astonishment is driven into primitive instinct so deeply that we strive to find ways to fulfill the thirst. Research is teaching us the ways of our ancestors, how their trials built foundations we live upon today - J.C.

The purpose of this site is to examine         and explain the facts and fiction of paranormal phenomena and provide resources         for experimentation and individual research.   In our scientifically-oriented society,         many tend to dismiss the strange and often spiritual phenomena that occur         virtually every day somewhere on the planet.  Admittedly, the unknown         can be quite frightening, but dismissing it outright definitely does not         make it disappear.  The fact remains that we are spiritual beings,         and nobody can dispute the assertion that there are ways to come by knowledge         and experience without the rigors of scientific research.  Meditation         is a classic example, to name just one.  Unexplainable things also         happen every day to normal, intelligent people - they see things, hear things,         feel presences, observe phenomenon, move objects without touching them, and         even sometimes become aware of what the future holds.  None of these         things can be explained scientifically, but there is a huge amount of anecdotal         evidence that suggests that there is indeed some basis of truth to many         of the stories, even some that are quite bizarre at first glance.   Having said that, these pages will cover         some very intriguing subjects, from monsters to ghosts, to the power of         the mind, so get comfortable, as you are in for a fascinating journey into         the strange, unusual, and bizarre.  This is an ongoing project, so         please excuse our "Under Construction" pages and be sure to Bookmark, as         we add new material almost daily.   Lastly, and especially with topics here         related to the mind and controlling your environment, consider the implications         and your own motives before attempting to take  on  such responsibilities.           Most of us are in the middle and do not extend auras 25 feet or control         the actions of others.

Welcome To Our Space On The Web ParaResearchers Of Ontario      Since April 1999 Para-Researchers of Ontario has offered an in-depth exploration of topics that are unusual in nature and therefore considered by most to be paranormal.

Throughout these 100s of pages you will discover articles written by researchers and experiencers alike, exclusive photos, case reports, and our own hands-on field research. We explore and encourage all ideas, opinions, and hypotheses. You will not find disclaimers here on the validity or truth of the material presented, nor is it our intention to prove/disprove hypotheses and beliefs in regards to these topics. Instead we encourage you to stretch your own mind and perhaps find your own truths within these pages.    Now grab your cup of coffee, sit back, relax, and join us in a journey through the realms of the unknown.  We are actively collecting stories and experiences from the province of Ontario.

[/vc_row]                        ABOUT PROJECT CAMELOT    Since its inception, Project Camelot has become a leader in the area of whistleblower testimony by providing filmed interviews, shot guerrilla style, on location, with key witnesses and researchers from all around the world. We have traveled to remote corners of the globe and revealed secrets in areas previously only known to a select few from secret societies and those with high level security clearances in the secret governments.  Project Camelot has now been operating for over 15 years.  After the first 3 years, Bill Ryan and Kerry Cassidy separated their operations and Kerry went solo running Project Camelot.To reach Kerry Cassidy email: kerry@projectcamelot.tv  READ MORE                                           PROJECT CAMELOT ON TWITTER    Follow @projectcamelot    Tweets by @projectcamelot       DISCLAIMER   Project Camelot does not necessarily agree with or endorse all of the views represented by those we interview or have on our radio shows, internet TV shows or other broadcasts and productions.

For those visiting for the first time - welcome! Everything willbe explained to you in a moment. For those who have entered here before- welcome back to the Project X website, renewed for the third time - and still in the process of being reshaped! Like all of you, in these accelerating Times of Shifts and Changeswe have been endlessly looking for the others, the Chosen Ones ,for additional people to share, to tell what we have gone through, whatis taking place around us right now , and what still awaits aheadfor the humankind. For, as we were told at the beginning of our spiritualjourney: You have the future, I have the past,  Together we create the world. You have strolled the World Wide Web, seeking an information, a clue,anything that sounded similar to the things you have experienced. The Internetoffered too much, but almost not a thing. You went through infinite chatrooms and Instant Messengers numbers, trying to reach those, who are, likeyourself, as arrogant and unusual as it may sound, the Chosen Ones ,other souls, who are now spiritually awakening. Since you've somehow reached this site, you haven't failed. For ourgroup truly had supernatural experiences, amazing encounters, breathtakingvisions, dreams, which told us our past and world's future. By the means of these webpages we hope to draw the attention of thosewho received preternatural guidance and messages from various origins.Dreams, visions, trance, hypnosis, abductions and many more; any meansare relevant when you speak of event(s), which altered your perspectiveof the world, of the Universe, of the Existence.    The following is a short introduction of the initial Project X groupand its experiences. For more explanations, you can refer to QuestionsAnswered and some of our archives ,as well as send us an e-mail with anything you wish to clarify. Our names are Alexander Aldarow, Rinor Zidran and Rami A.Q.. Thereare many others, too, as our circle is unstoppably growing. This processbegan several years ago, when we tried to explore the reincarnations, throughregressive hypnosis. At first, Rinor spoke about his past lives, but thenvisions, symbols and messages from non-physical entities came through.Since then we have experienced and tried seances, meditations, astral projection,dream telepathy, and, the most important of all, cosmic messages . We have contacted with spirits, ghosts, angels, demons, aliens,our subconsciousness and various entities, such as the Old Ones, Nostradamus,Dix, Rob (the gray angel), Zifron (gray angels' supervisor), Orkon (/Arekon),ATP (the vagabond), Master-30/Dragon-tzar/Moadib/Aries/? (all are namesof one evil being), Men in Black, the Ark Carriers, the Guide, the Source. Since then, naturally, our views and approach to the supernaturalhave changed. Those experiences and encounters were the jumping board;today our spiritual paths have become more individualized. Nonetheless,the same yearning to grow and develop have remained. There is no goingback. Go through this site. See how everything is connected into one all-encompassingpuzzle. Do not forget - we respect all your responses; we are here to listen,help and share. You and us have a lot to offer to each other. To quoteone of the received messages: And the silence will rule, but not.

Loads of people have and they’re keen to share their experiences both via my anonymous Paranormal Phenomena survey and here on my website. My aim is to educate, inform, support and even challenge the way people think and feel about paranormal activity.  In addition, I’ve produced a series of books on astrology and they are available to purchase via Amazon .  WARNING: With the release of the film Ouija I am concerned that people, particularly young people, will be tempted to dabble. A word of advice: DON’T. Psychic energy is real and playing with it can have devastating consequences.                    Background  This website, Psychic Revolution is a natural extension of the academic research which I carried out at Monash University in Australia. My dissertation was entitled: “The Nature, Incidence, Impact, and Integration of Spontaneous Parapsychological Experiences” and the results of the internet survey are cited elsewhere on the Internet, including Wikipedia.  Over 4,000 surveys, from the residents of 59 countries were submitted in the original survey. Due to popular demand, my survey is once again ‘live’ on the Internet. The aim of this research is to create the largest database of paranormal experiences ever collected anywhere in the world. If you haven’t already completed a survey, then do so! Here’s the link to the Paranormal Phenomena survey.          Finding Your Way around Psychic Revolution  If you’d like to see what others have written (anonymously) about their own encounters with the paranormal just click on the links below or in the navigation bar. You’ll also find links to other paranormal websites, paranormal research, the occasional paranormal blog, and loads more of information on paranormal phenomena.  Please explore the site and drop me an email. I am building a community here and I love to chat with the members. So, have a look around and let me know if there is something I can help you with. If I don’t know the answer maybe I know someone who does :).

What People Are Saying at Psychic Revolution           I think each person who passes decides for self if they are wanting to hang around and help the people they love and are still on earth OR if they choose to go forward. I do feel that out of love people who have passed would have a difficult time going forward knowing that their loved ones are grieving enough that the loved one left here cannot move forward.   Sharón  Afterlife       Before my mother died after being semi comatose for a week, she suddenly opened her eyes and looked surprised to see me. I told her everything was alright and her parents were waiting for her. She put her hand on my head and I calmly waited for her to leave her body. I was not aware of any lights except for the happy face she had, caused by what ever it was she saw behind me.   Anne  Death and Dying       My Sophie, 13 years, is having a disturbing recurring dream which she believes is prophetic. It’s deeply traumatic for her because it involves the death of her little sister. She says the clarity in the dream makes it feel very real and it plays out exactly the same each time. She has had a dream in the last twelve months involving a friend and a pregnancy which was correct.  She has also been speaking about shadows and thinking I’ve walked down the hallway, when I haven’t. She has not slept very well for a couple of years on and off and is very sensitive. I’ve always put her sleeping trouble down to anxiety. I really need some help to find some strategies to work through this with her.  As a parent I find myself asking how I distinguish between potentially premonition or bad dreams? How can I help her sleep easy.   Michelle  Dreams       I believe that out of the body experiences are quite common as I have spoken to many people about this and been favourably received and they have said that they have thought that, yes, they HAVE had this experience. I have been able to do this since as far back as I can remember in that, I am able to walk around the house at night and check to see what’s going on and am then able to go back to my bedroom and see myself lying in bed. I just return to my body ‘in my mind’ and that is what happens.  Several years ago, I was asked if other people could see me when I did this and I had to say that I did not know BUT I then thought I wonder if I can make this happen? I therefore decided to try to go to my son’s home and try to see what happened.  I had gone to bed as normal and visualised my son’s living room and walked through from the front hall into the back dining room. I was able to see that my son and his mate were sitting watching TV- it was about 11pm.  As I walked behind the sofa I saw them both turn round and stare at me – I was so amazed by this that I did not try to communicate with them I just carried on walking in my mind and went back to my body at home.   Judy  Paranormal Activity          My mother died over four years ago. She was in ER and I had stepped out for a brief time. As I went back towards the room she was in she was glowing and looked so beautiful. I stopped mid-step as she was asleep, and out of pain and glowing. She was over 86, but at that moment I could see the radiant beauty of her younger days. I did not re-enter the room – not wanting to would disturb her. Within 24 hours she was gone; so that’s the last time I “saw” her.   MKH  Golden Glow of Death       My dog passed away summer 2012.  After a few weeks I began to sense her presence with me, her affection, love, and the essence of her character. These events came out of the blue to me, were very strong, definitely her, and were full of love, which even seemed to have grown “bigger” since her passing (at the time I was unsure about life after death for anyone, dogs included, although I’d had out of body experiences before, I’d never had one in which I met anyone deceased.)   Sylvia  Pet Death       I have certain types of dreams that always come true. I had one this morning 11/4/12 that an 8.11 earthquake would hit the west coast. These dreams always come true within a 30 day period or within 24 hours. I’ve never reported them before except once when the air force thunderbirds crashed. I reported that one to the air traffic tower at El Toro marine base. They did not have a flight of seven planes coming in. But one hour later the thunderbirds crashed 7 of them in colorado. This dream is too big not to pay attention too.   Jeff  Premonitions       I was born (1956) into an extremely strict Lutheran household that changed over to an Evangelical Covenant Church when my father became ordained and accepted an Associate Pastoral position. Every Sunday, as I grew up, I heard the messages of “God’s love” for me while Monday thru Saturday I heard the message of “I’m only beating you because I love you”!  My siblings, much older than I, left me alone in this dilemma when I was but 6 years old and to say the least, I was confused as to how “Love” was characterized as physical trauma on a regular basis. At 16 I was lucky enough to fall under the good graces of my Art Teacher, who was a professed Pagan, practicing the Left Hand Path of the Ásatrú Folk. Being of Nordic Descent myself, this made perfect sense to me.  I began researching, in earnest, my family history only to find out that many of my ancestors were of one belief or the other; Pagan, of which little was mentioned on the Family Tree my mother so proudly worked on for years, or Christian, of which seeming volumes of trivial minutia filled the tiny leafs next to their names. I researched and studied my entire life into both aspects of my family’s Continuum.   Dave  Religion          I believe that, in general, it is good to be open and welcoming to most energy around us. However, there are some energetic influences that we do not want to allow within our fields.   Rachel  Psychic Shield       A few months ago, I was meditating regularly with the hope of having an OBE. After doing this for a couple of weeks, something strange began to happen: dead people started telling me their life stories (at least that’s what it feels like.) Words and images pop into my head, unbidden, sometimes with alarming clarity and they don’t let go until I write them down. After I’d filled half a notebook, I thought I should share them on a blog.   Lives of the dead  Reincarnation       I had run down to the basement laundry facility of an old apartment building where we, (myself, my husband and 2 children) lived on the second floor. It was dead quiet, since it was around 1:30 AM in the wee small hours, and most who lived there were retired for the night. While pulling my clothes from the dryer and putting them in the basket, I suddenly knew I was not alone, and at that same instant I also felt this pulling, magnetic like sensation at and around the lower back of my head but mostly my neck, and this feeling instantly tells you someone is there, and like, they are looking at you.  So when I turned around to my left, I wasn’t actually surprised…shocked, yes, but not surprised, to see a man standing there…this back of the neck feeling just tells you there’s a presence. I had never had this experience before, which is so strange since on having it, there was like a “knowing”…it “told me” someone was there. He was dressed in clothing from an earlier period, like late 1800’s or early 1900’s..it was a black suit, but the long coat tail kind of jacket, white shirt and tie, and one of those Abe Lincoln hats, but the less tall kind..but these clothes looked very rumpled and soiled, like he had slept in them a lot. He was rather tall, real thin, and his face..very gaunt…and his eyes were dark and sunken.   Dolly  Ghosts       I was wondering if anyone can help me. My daughter is 9 and has screaming voices in her head. She has to sleep with the light on and cries daily.  When she was younger she saw people but hasn’t mentioned anything in awhile.  We also have a lot of things that happen in our house from things being moved to the radio turning itself on, to toys playing by themselves.  We don’t have idea how we can help her. So if anyone has ideas please let me know. Thank you.   Donna  Psychic Kids                   Privacy Policy  About  Terms of Use  DMCA  Disclaimer  Write for us

"Ned" Beach, Jr.<br /><br />There is a coincidence attached to the circumnavigation.<br /><br />As the submarine was making it's submerged journey it raised periscope in the Philippines' Magellan Bay. On doing so Captain Beach found himself staring into the eyes of a startled fisherman in a canoe!<br /><br />For a long time, in the 1960s, it was wondered, "Who was the fisherman?" The&nbsp;<i>National Geographic Magazine</i>&nbsp;actually managed to trace him on Mactan island off Cebu. He was, at the time, a 19 year old called Rufino Baring.<br /><br />Rufino told of how he was terrified when the&nbsp;<i>eye</i>&nbsp;of the huge nuclear submarine unexpectedly broke water and then vanished. He said,&nbsp;<i>"I was tired and thought I was seeing things. But when it came back a second time, I thought it was part of a very big monster and I was frightened. I tried to get away as fast as I could because it started to move very fast."</i><br /><br />Rufino paddled frantically for home but didn't tell his family about what he had seen.<br /><br />The incident was described by Captain Beach in his log:</span><br /><div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; margin: 0px; padding: 15px;"><div class="separator" style="background-color: #f4cccc; clear: both; color: #666666; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, Trebuchet, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_ZnVTzKzRAs/VenHm99H5kI/AAAAAAAAeAU/K4PwVWiwq-o/s1600/USS-triton.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; color: #436590; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; text-decoration-line: none;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_ZnVTzKzRAs/VenHm99H5kI/AAAAAAAAeAU/K4PwVWiwq-o/s320/USS-triton.jpg" style="border: none; position: relative;" width="241" /></span></a></div><span style="background-color: white; color: #3d85c6; font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;">"Upon raising the periscope. I am looking right into the eyes of a young man in a small canoe, close alongside. Perhaps he has detected the dark bulk of our hull in the relatively clear waters of the bay ...<br /><br />A few seconds later I motion for the scope to be raised once more. Sure enough there is our friend, impassively leaning on his gunwales and staring right at the periscope as it rises barely two inches out of the water.<br /><br />It's a ludicrous situation: On the one hand an impassive Asian, staring with curious concentration at an unusual object in the water; on the other a US Navy Officer, equipped with all the technical devices money can procure, looking back with equally studied concentration. On one end of the periscope, an outrigger canoe propelled by the brawny arms of its builder; on the other end a $100,000,000 submarine, the newest, biggest, most powerful in the world, on a history-making cruise.<br /><br />What an abyss - what centuries of scientific development lie between him and me!"</span></div><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666; font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;">When Rufino was eventually traced he thought he must have committed some sort of crime and was very relieved to be told otherwise.<br /><br />He was unaware that his photo had been taken through Triton's periscope. When he was told that he was the only person who saw Triton on it's voyage, the information was greeted simply with an embarrassed smile.<br /><br />And now for an uncanny coincidence about this story.<br /><br />In making the voyage, in early 1960, Triton began and ended the circumnavigation from St Peter and St Paul Rocks off Brazil.<br /><br /></span></div><p><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;">Rufino, frightened after his experience, repainted his canoe and added two saints' names to protect it from further meetings with sea monsters. The apostles' names he chose were: St Peter and St Paul!</span></span>&nbsp;</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/67notout/tRDb/~4/cJQ95U6Ic0U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/> Mike Perry http://www.blogger.com/profile/02149847109691591945 noreply@blogger.com 0 http://www.67notout.com/2020/11/coincidence-of-first-nuclear-submarine.html tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3569682519423498805.post-2192470760178952674 2020-11-24T16:42:00.000+00:00 2020-11-24T16:42:27.555+00:00 <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b9b9qEwS91M/VpfM9PEhEWI/AAAAAAAAmgs/JQuuL54zqtM/s1600/morris-minor-van.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="Morris Minor Van" border="0" height="350" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b9b9qEwS91M/VpfM9PEhEWI/AAAAAAAAmgs/JQuuL54zqtM/w640-h350/morris-minor-van.jpg" width="600" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Morris Van</td></tr></tbody></table><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;"><span face="Verdana, sans-serif">A coincidence story today - there seem to be a lot about at the moment!

She is said to have made many accurate predictions. Friends and associates therefore become concerned when she revealed what would be her own imminent death.</span></span><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;">She told them, "I saw a fiery streak. Then a red mist spread over everything ..."</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;">She explained, her long experience had taught her that red mists always meant one thing: "Blood, a violent death. A fiery streak"&nbsp;</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;">A few weeks following her prediction a Nazi&nbsp;</span><i style="background-color: white; color: #666666;">buzz bomb</i><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;">&nbsp;(this was during World War 2) struck her London Home. This answered the question as to what the 'fiery streak' actually was. She had accurately predicted her death.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;">Prior to her death illustrious clients included the former Queen Victoria of Spain and Lady Clarisbrook - whose husband was a brother of Britain's Queen at the time. Victoria's first consultation with Miss Montague was one she wouldn't forget.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;">She warned Victoria that her wedding day would be the occasion of a number of violent deaths. The prediction was stunningly fulfilled.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;">As the bridal party drove away from the church a bouquet containing a bomb, was tossed at the royal carriage. Both the King and Queen escaped injury, but 24 other people were killed and 80 were wounded.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;">It is also reported that someone handed her an example of Hitler's handwriting. She, not knowing whose it was, said, "Whoever wrote that is as mad as a hatter."</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;">There are many other predictions that proved accurate. In 1944 she forecast that Lord Louis Mountbatten "... will some day find a watery grave." This was shown in various newspapers in November of 1944.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;">The prediction took a long time to materialise, but in 1979 Lord Mountbatten went lobster potting in a wooden boat, moored in the harbour at Mullaghmore. An IRA member slipped into the boat and planted a radio-controlled bomb. Just a few hundred yards from the shore the bomb was detonated. Mountbatten was killed.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;">Some people do appear to have 'the gift'.</span></span><p></p><div><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;"><i>Thank you for visiting my blog.

The route details were on a leaflet. It was about five miles through woods and across fields. Sounded fine for a mild afternoon.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;"></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;">We set off and soon got into our stride, not another soul anywhere to be seen - so perfect for walking and forgetting the rest of the world.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;">For a while the pathway was alongside a small river, which we then had to cross using some stepping stones, and make our way up the side of the valley via some uneven stone steps. A reasonable climb and shouldn't have been any problem.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;"></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;">We were nearly to the top when my wife must have missed the step or slipped on the uneven rocks - whatever - she started to fall backwards. I was a couple of steps behind her ... it was then that time stood still!</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;"></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;">Thoughts started flowing through my mind ...</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;"></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;">"When my wife hits me I will fall backwards as well ...

I felt my back foot being lowered to the step below and, goodness knows how, I caught her! I didn't fall and neither of us were hurt.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;"></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;">The point is that time did stand still, I can't possibly have had all of those thoughts in a normal, every day, time frame.

My wife was shaken and in tears thinking of what might have happened and said words to the effect that our Guardian Angel must have been looking after us. I still can't explain how I caught her.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #666666;" /><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;"></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666;">I've only experienced that sort of thing once.

I'd missed most of the details so I did a bit of research this morning.&nbsp;</span><div><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;">I found a report in&nbsp;<i>The Evening News</i>&nbsp;of October 12, 1903 titled&nbsp;<b>Half Human, Half Beast, With Great Bat-Like Wings</b>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here's the report - I always like the way they worded newspapers back then.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="background-color: white; font-family: georgia; font-size: xx-large;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;"><span style="background-color: white;">The town of Van Meter, conta1ning, 1000&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">persons is terribly wrought up by what is described as a horrible monster. Every man, woman and child in the town is in a state of terror, and fully half of them fail to close their eyes in slumber except in broad daylight.&nbsp;</span></span><div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 15px; padding: 15px;"><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;"><br />Friday night while the population was keeping the dreadful vigil every electric light in the city was kept burning to satisfy the most timid.&nbsp;<br /><br />The monster put in its appearance Monday night. U.S Griffith, an implement dealer, drove into town at 1 a.m. and saw what seemed to be an electric searchlight on Maher &amp; Grigg's store. While he gazed it sailed across to another building and then disappeared.&nbsp;<br /><br />His story was not believed the next day. But the following night Dr. A.C Olcott, who sleeps in his office on the principal street, was awakened by a bright light shining in his face.&nbsp;<br /><br />He grabbed a shotgun and ran outside the building where he saw a monster, seemingly half human and half beast, with great bat-like wings. A dazzling light that fairly blinded him came from a blunt, horn-like protuberance in the middle of the animal's forehead and it gave off a stupefying odour that almost overcome him.&nbsp;<br /><br />The doctor discharged his weapon and fled into his office, barring doors and windows, and remained there in abject terror until next morning.&nbsp;<br /><br />Peter Dunn, cashier in the only bank in town, fearing bank robbers, loaded a repeating shotgun with shells filled with buckshot, and prepared to guard his funds next night. At 2p.m he was blinded by the presence of a light of great intensity.&nbsp;<br /><br />Eventually he recovered his senses sufficiently to distinguish the monster and fired through the window. The plate glass and sash were torn out and the monster disappeared. Next morning imprints of great three-toes feet were discernible in the soft earth.&nbsp;<br /><br />That night Dr. O.V White saw the monster climbing down a telephone pole, using a beak much in the manner of a parrot. As it struck the ground it seemed to travel in leaps, like a kangaroo, using it's huge featherless wings to assist. It gave off no light. He fired at it and he believed he wounded it. The shot was followed by an overpowering odour. Sidney Gregg attracted by the shot, saw the monster fly away.&nbsp;<br /><br />But the climax came Friday night. The whole town was aroused by this time. Professor Martin, principal of the schools, decided that from the description it was an&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antediluvian">antedeluvian</a>&nbsp;animal.&nbsp;<br /><br />Shortly after midnight J.L Platt, foreman of the brick plant, heard a peculiar sound in an abandoned coal mine, and as the men had reported a similar sound before, a body of volunteers started an investigation. Presently the monster emerged from the shaft, accompanied by a smaller one. A score of shots were fired without effect.&nbsp;<br /><br />The whole town was aroused and a vigil maintained the rest of the night, but without result until just at dawn, when the two monsters returned and disappeared down the shaft.&nbsp;<br /><br />A watch was kept again last night, but without result. The town geniuses are devising various plans to capture the monsters.&nbsp;</span></span></div><br /><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;"><b>Note:</b> The coal mine is no longer in existence.</span></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/67notout/tRDb/~4/SIGfa5x6XFk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/> Mike Perry http://www.blogger.com/profile/02149847109691591945 noreply@blogger.com 0 http://www.67notout.com/2020/10/the-creature-half-human-half-beast-with.html tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3569682519423498805.post-8182786073449713175 2020-10-02T15:26:00.004+01:00 2020-10-02T15:26:58.944+01:00 <div class="separator"><div class="separator" style="clear: center; float: center; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" data-original-height="321" data-original-width="400" height="321" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wrxu-GRaSRw/X3c1WCbkpQI/AAAAAAABfmw/p9r6tu5boSE4V4L72rEYu9oQHkJSBHYLwCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h321/servant-girl.jpg" width="400" /></div></div><br /><div><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;"><span>An experience&nbsp; from a Mr. Thomas which is about a time shift and seeing into the past and perhaps a former life.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;"><span face="Verdana, sans-serif"><br /></span></span><div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 15px; padding: 15px;"><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;"><span face="Verdana, sans-serif">I had cause some years back to go and collect a load of straw from some farm buildings in Gloucestershire. A colleague, Anne, came with me for the ride, which I undertook in a small lorry, not much bigger than a pick-up truck.</span><br /><span face="Verdana, sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="Verdana, sans-serif">I collected the straw and took this to the lorry. I noticed that Anne looked a little strained when I got ready to drive back, but I didn't mention the fact to her.</span><br /><span face="Verdana, sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="Verdana, sans-serif">After we had delivered the straw she told me what had happened at the farm.</span><br /><span face="Verdana, sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="Verdana, sans-serif">She said that as soon as I had left the cab, to load the straw, the whole place changed. She was now in a courtyard with other buildings at the side of the yard.</span><br /><span face="Verdana, sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="Verdana, sans-serif">She saw herself as standing in the centre of the courtyard but as a young woman of about fifteen or sixteen years old (whereas in fact she was in her early twenties).</span><br /><span face="Verdana, sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="Verdana, sans-serif">The young woman she saw in the courtyard in no way resembled her and was dressed as a servant girl from past centuries. Despite this she instantly knew this woman was actually herself and she suddenly found herself standing in the courtyard, and she 'became' the servant girl.</span><br /><span face="Verdana, sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="Verdana, sans-serif">A horse came galloping into the courtyard, the rider dressed in old style clothes and wearing a three cornered hat. The horse reared up into the air close by her, frightening her, then another horse and rider galloped in and did the same thing.</span><br /><span face="Verdana, sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="Verdana, sans-serif">She was aware that the second horse and rider had chased the first one into the courtyard. She was terrified and knew that they were going to fight.</span><br /><span face="Verdana, sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="Verdana, sans-serif">She could not get from in between the two prancing horses, as the two men fought with swords. She did not experience being killed, but knew she was trampled to death under the hoofs of the horses.</span><br /><span face="Verdana, sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="Verdana, sans-serif">Anne said the whole incident appeared to take about ten minutes but, in reality, she knew it had only been a few seconds. She swore she had not been to sleep.</span><br /><span face="Verdana, sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="Verdana, sans-serif">Later I discovered that the place concerned was, centuries ago, a manor house farm and the foundations of the original buildings were where my lorry was parked.</span><br /><span face="Verdana, sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="Verdana, sans-serif">I believe that the reason why she had this vision was because her subconscious was excited because she was on the exact spot where she was killed so many lifetimes ago. This glimpse of a previous reincarnation may have been to give her a shock so she would start thinking about what her present life was really for.</span><br /><span face="Verdana, sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="Verdana, sans-serif">Don't know if readers will agree with my explanation.</span><br /><span face="Verdana, sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="Verdana, sans-serif">~ Mr Thomas</span></span></span></div></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/67notout/tRDb/~4/geCbKXJ9Jo0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/> Mike Perry http://www.blogger.com/profile/02149847109691591945 noreply@blogger.com 0 http://www.67notout.com/2020/10/stepping-through-time-slip-and-into-her.html tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3569682519423498805.post-7580176875305551742 2020-09-23T16:56:00.002+01:00 2020-09-23T16:57:52.077+01:00 <p>&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gpL6e9Jx88s/X2ttv7Rv3PI/AAAAAAABffA/A-_HwwVZjfUphNC9W6AQ4KFDrXqg4wtxwCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" data-original-height="264" data-original-width="600" height="422" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gpL6e9Jx88s/X2ttv7Rv3PI/AAAAAAABffA/A-_HwwVZjfUphNC9W6AQ4KFDrXqg4wtxwCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h422/image.png" width="600" /></a></div><br /><p></p><p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;"><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif">In the 1970s a guy called Terry Thomas did several experiments regarding, what he claimed, was astral travel. Terry operated from a 'clinic' in Wales and practised hypnotherapy.</span><br /><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif">His view was that hypnotherapy differed from hypnosis. Under hypnosis, he argued, the subject is under the complete control of the hypnotist and does only what he commands. Whereas, under hypnotherapy, the subject's subconscious (unconscious) is controlled more by their conscious mind.</span><br /><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif">Whatever the case isn't really too important. What I want to write about is the fact that Terry Thomas recorded lots of people while under hypnotherapy. The following is one such case.</span><br /><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif">The subject was a man called John who didn't believe in God, astral travel or any other such 'nonsense'.</span><br /><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif">John, however, agreed to let Terry use hypnotherapy on him as an experiment. After a ten minute session Terry asked him what he had experienced.</span><br /><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif">He replied,&nbsp;<em>"Nothing really, only stupid imagination. I heard you telling me to take my Astral body out of my physical body and go and visit my brother. I felt myself leaving my body, then I saw my brother, who was with my mother and my other brother. It was only imagination."&nbsp;</em></span><br /><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif">Terry got John to phone his brother, who lived 40 miles away, and to ask him what he had been doing for the last ten or fifteen minutes. John was staggered to find out it was exactly as he had seen and heard while under hypnotherapy.</span><br /><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif">Because of this John agreed to another session but this time, to make sure Terry wasn't cheating, he chose a friend who wasn't known to the hypnotherapist.</span><br /><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif">Again, to John's bewilderment, what he saw and heard under hypnotherapy checked out. He had seen his friend in a building which he himself had never visited, yet he described it all perfectly.</span><br /><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif">There were several more sessions and then Terry 'sent' John to see his dead father, who had died many years earlier.</span><br /><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif">The whole 'visit' lasted under two minutes. Afterwards he was asked what he had seen.</span><br /><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif">John, who was accompanied by his mother at the session, replied with tears in his eyes,&nbsp;<em>"Mam, you have no need to worry, Dad is very happy and has no marks on his face, he looks beautiful, no marks whatsoever, not even lines or wrinkles, he looks much younger than when he died."</em></span><br /><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif">It seems that John's father had marks on his face through coal mine injuries.</span><br /></span><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif"><br /></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MwoelmJjo1c/VwUb0UXXiQI/AAAAAAAArxg/uIXCd-D1vasQDpr93grRW7ueEbqvImHWw/s1600/travel-2.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="Astral Travel" border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MwoelmJjo1c/VwUb0UXXiQI/AAAAAAAArxg/uIXCd-D1vasQDpr93grRW7ueEbqvImHWw/s1600/travel-2.jpg" /></a></div><p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;"><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif">John continued,&nbsp;<em>"I went and knelt before him, my father put his hand on my shoulder and then seemed to go into me and I became part of him. I am surprised beyond words that I was only there for minutes, as I felt that I was there for what I can only describe as a thousand years, a long, long time. I saw many wonders, things I could never imagine, I was told so much, but I knew I would remember nothing of these wonders on my return. The only thing I remember is my father fetching me and putting me back in my body."</em></span><br /><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif">I don't want to make this post too long but in further hypnotherapy sessions John recorded previous lives and even the moment of death in one of them. He is on tape as saying,&nbsp;<em>"I'm laying here bad, aren't I? My heart has stopped beating, I feel myself going cold, my heart is going hard. I am dead! ... I am looking down hearing and watching my family grieve over me, but I feel no grief, I am happy."</em></span><br /><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif">John is also said to have made 'visits' to Mars and the Moon via hypnotherapy.</span><br /><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif"><br /></span><span face="&quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif">As I often say, it's up to the individual as to what he or she makes of this post.

I took a deep breath, which probably wasn't a wise thing to do, and mumbled something like,&nbsp;<i>"Hello Timmy and what a lovely day it is Mr J****,"</i>&nbsp;and with that I turned round and shakily walked away.</span><br style="color: #666666;" /><span style="color: #666666;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: #f4cccc; color: #666666;"></span><span style="color: #666666;">We went to a different beach the following day!

As above so below, he insists, and is capable of acerbity and ridicule when confronted with the notion of being asleep in the arms of Jesus and maudling affections of the old fashioned church. After death comes LIFE not sleep!</span></p><p><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;">He agrees that death is followed by a period of rest, restoration and recuperation but, with devastating humour he claims we are all better off dead!

What's more we could also leave our car there as well.</span></p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: xx-large;"><span style="background-color: #f4cccc;"></span><span face="">We thought this was great as the flight was early in the morning and it would save us on parking fees and getting up very early to travel to Heathrow</span></span><div><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: xx-large;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: xx-large;">The flat was quite small but perfect for a night's sleep. In the evening we put our son to bed and, after watching a little television, decided to have an early night. I used the bathroom first and settled into bed with my book. The bedroom was virtually opposite the bathroom and I left the door open while my husband showered.</span><div><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: xx-large;"><span face=""><br /></span><span style="background-color: #f4cccc;"></span><span face="">I was reading away and glanced up and saw what I took to be my husband walking down the hall-way. It looked like he was just wearing his shirt and nothing else, which was a bit odd, but I thought no more about it. I imagined he was going to the kitchen for a drink of water or something.</span><br /><span face=""><br /></span><span style="background-color: #f4cccc;"></span><span face="">I got back to my book and then heard a noise from the bathroom. This puzzled me and then my husband came out of the bathroom door, wearing a towel around his waist, a shiver went down my spine,&nbsp;<em>"Where's your shirt?"</em>&nbsp;I asked.</span><br /><span face=""><br /></span><span style="background-color: #f4cccc;"></span><span face="">He looked strangely at me (nothing unusual there) and said,&nbsp;<i>"Why?"</i></span><br /><span face=""><br /></span><span style="background-color: #f4cccc;"></span><span face=""><i>"Well you were wearing it a few minutes ago when you went to the kitchen."</i></span><br /><span face=""><br /></span><span style="background-color: #f4cccc;"></span><span face=""><i>"What are you talking about? I've been in the bathroom, not the kitchen,"</i>&nbsp;he snapped.</span><br /><span face=""><br /></span><span style="background-color: #f4cccc;"></span><span face="">Another shiver went down my spine as I explained what I'd seen: the man in a shirt. My husband went and searched the flat but everything was secure, all the doors and windows locked.&nbsp;<em>"Your imagination,"</em>&nbsp;he said.</span><br /><span face=""><br /></span><span style="background-color: #f4cccc;"></span><span face="">Then we heard our son cry out,&nbsp;<em>"Mum, there's an orange floating in my room."</em></span><br /><span face=""><br /></span><span style="background-color: #f4cccc;"></span><span face="">We both rushed to his room, next to ours, and he was standing on the bed pointing at what appeared to be an orange globe. This travelled along the wall and then suddenly disappeared.</span><br /><span face=""><br /></span><span style="background-color: #f4cccc;"></span><span face=""><em>"The man in his nightshirt left it here,"</em>&nbsp;said our son. He was trembling with fear.</span><br /><span face=""><br /></span><span style="background-color: #f4cccc;"></span><span face="">Again my husband searched the flat but, as before, all was secure. I think even he was a bit spooked by now. The three of us got into bed, leaving the hall light on, and tried to sleep. In the morning we were glad when our taxi arrived to take us to our flight terminal.</span><br /><span face=""><br /></span><span style="background-color: #f4cccc;"></span><span face="">We were going to stop at the flat overnight again after our holiday but, instead, we picked up our car from the car park and made our way home. No way was I going inside that flat again.</span><br /><span face=""><br /></span><span style="background-color: #f4cccc;"></span><span face="">We told our friend about the incident but he just laughed and joked that it was probably his dad wondering what we were doing there. As for the globe, maybe a reflection from passing traffic.</span><br /><span face=""><br /></span><span style="background-color: #f4cccc;"></span><span face="">I don't know what or who it was but I know what I saw.</span><br /><span face=""><br /></span><span style="background-color: #f4cccc;"></span><span face="">~ Maureen</span></span><div><span face="" style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: georgia;

No doubt you've heard such stories previously. Some say they are from angels. Perhaps a Guardian Angel.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;">I haven't reached a definite opinion about angels and/or white feathers but the following is something that happened to me.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;">The first time I experienced white feathers was when I bought a new car. There, on a grass verge next to my car, when I went to collect it, were three white feathers, all lined up next to each other. I read afterwards that finding three feathers is supposedly your Guardian Angel letting you know they are about.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;">The car purchase was a little odd because, being me, I shopped around for the best price. I took ages deciding and then finally, to my wife's disappointment, reached the conclusion that the car I wanted was slightly too expensive.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;">That night I tried visualisation, seeing the car at the price I could afford and requesting that this would come about. By this I mean that I sat quietly picturing myself with a new car and buying it at a price I was happy about - cosmic ordering if you like. (Mind you, I should have simply visualised the car being mine without any price tag. I now know better!)</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;">Nevertheless the next day my wife was seeing one of her dressmaking clients. In the general chat my wife mentioned the car I was thinking about buying.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;">Now by chance / coincidence, or whatever, the client said she had a friend who was a car dealer and sold this particular make. She went on to say he was desperate for a few sales otherwise he could lose his dealership. Seemingly he had to sell a target number of cars each quarter.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;">She phoned him to see what sort of price he would take for the model I wanted. He gave his 'bottom' price and I said this was still too expensive. He asked what sort of price I hoped to pay. I told him, via the dress making client, and he agreed on a price&nbsp;<em>below</em>&nbsp;what I was willing to pay. He reckoned he wouldn't make any money on the deal - that could have just have been car sales talk. But I was more than happy with the result</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;">So, to sum up, I'd asked the universe / cosmic, or whatever you want to call it, for a car at a certain price and I got it. Then, when I picked up the car, there were three white feathers lying next to it - a message of confirmation perhaps from a higher level? Or just my imagination?</span><br /><br /><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/67notout/tRDb/~4/wcPVTQCC9E4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/> Mike Perry http://www.blogger.com/profile/02149847109691591945 noreply@blogger.com 0 http://www.67notout.com/2020/07/were-three-white-feathers-sign-that.html tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3569682519423498805.post-1643488870219250098 2020-07-24T12:43:00.000+01:00 2020-07-24T12:43:01.156+01:00 <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2jWPeGDkiEw/XxrD5kRha4I/AAAAAAABe3I/uYRd_9dUZmsAyFl9H0SPnMOlFQOMfCVXACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/book-1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="The Voynich Manuscript" border="0" data-original-height="996" data-original-width="752" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2jWPeGDkiEw/XxrD5kRha4I/AAAAAAABe3I/uYRd_9dUZmsAyFl9H0SPnMOlFQOMfCVXACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/book-1.png" title="" width="482" /></a></div><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;">The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University houses a very mysterious manuscript known as The Voynich Manuscript.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JF741bopGvg/XxrE3QNUFUI/AAAAAAABe3c/f2uFihs-8QIRWGe_bGTL3xAhyiM3l2suQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/book-2.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A creature within the Voynich Manuscript" border="0" data-original-height="359" data-original-width="307" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JF741bopGvg/XxrE3QNUFUI/AAAAAAABe3c/f2uFihs-8QIRWGe_bGTL3xAhyiM3l2suQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/book-2.png" title="" width="273" /></a></div><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;">Why so strange?

       Paranormal Activity  - and other weird stuff...  Read this in your own language.         What Is the Paranormal?  paranormal :   at its root: Greek para- (beyond) + Eng normal (that which is normative or that which follows the general rule).  that which doesn't happen within the 'normal' limits of material living or which can't be explained by the laws of nature or physics. That which is unsolved or unexplained or beyond our usual frame of reference. Mysteries, usually of a quasi-scientific or miraculous kind.  A catch-all category of popular thought, designed to mix together all that is weird, whether fairly or unfairly, related or unrelated. It's very much the rage on the Internet. Paranormal witnesses abound on phenomena both well-known and esoteric. 'Paranormal' includes scary ghosts and ghost hunters, zombies, vampires, horoscopes, UFOs, crop circles, apocalypses, seeing-stones, and strange powers. These are far more fun than scary people, ideas, or weapons. Maybe that's because we sense the difference, even when our minds don't grasp it.    An Eye On the Paranormal  Links to our pages on paranormal activity. (Nothing here is hidden, shrouded, secret, or in a paranormal state. ... OK, maybe a little weird .) The paranormal is where imagination and reality meet and part ways, in ways that some people swear are real. Paranormal stories arouse people's interest all over the world. They try to figure out these unsolved mysteries. So don't be frightened, take a look. Click or tap the buttons below.     Paranormal and Unsolved Mysteries  Angels astrology Auras  Bible Codes  Channeling  Crystals  Demons  Exorcism ghosts Holy Objects  Hypnosis  Levitation  Magic  a Magician in the New Testament  Mind Control  Multiple Personality Disorder  Mystery  Communication With the Dead  Numerology  Psychics  Satan  Telekinesis  Telepathy  the Unseen  Visualization  the Voice Within     Christianity and the Paranormal  Some complain that Christianity is no different than the paranormal -- the King of the unknown , the God of the gaps in our knowledge, the Lord of fog banks, clouds, and shrouds . But when we speak of Jesus, we put the lie to that. The Lord was not in a fog or a gap, but in cities, trade routes, and rural zones, walking on dirt in lousy sandals, talking words to other people, touching them, breathing air, traveling, crying, sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying. For just a while, God was in the same muck we are, and had to cope with it. There's no 'gap' in that. God destroyed the 'gap' as we were trying to destroy Jesus. God is usually hidden, true, but is hidden behind what's in plain sight and in ordinary experience, close at hand not galaxies away. (It's hidden in part so we can be free to be as we are.) Even where there is mystery to it, it's not the mystery of a fog, it seems like nothing but a burning light, so strong it blinds. To a Christian, the supernatural and the material realms are different sides to the same reality of existence. Imagine this, if you will: two dimensions to the same universe, interlocked at every turn; wherever one is, the other is, unseen. Incarnation - being here as a bodily being, as Jesus - is what separates God from what we call the paranormal.  Are there paranormal occurences? The core of the Christian faith says yes, constantly, but not most of what you usually think of as paranormal. Even much of what we see as normal, isn't. There is an entire side of this existence that underlies all that is, including the most 'normal' of things, that is the groundwork for the world as it is becoming.  It is farther beyond our typical experiences than anything that's usually thrown into the bin of 'paranormal' -- it's the 'new normal' of the road ahead of all of us. Perhaps this is what we really sense when there seems to be something more to life than the eye can see, a para- paranormal that is what makes the real real . Or, to describe it spatially: it's not reality turned around 180 degrees, but more like reality turned around 359 degrees, but we can't turn the 1 degree backward to find it the easy way. Put your trust not in paranormal phenomena, but the God who is at the root of whatever real stuff there is, whether within our world or beyond it.

   STRANGEhome     TIME TRAVEL     Is Time Travel Possible? Has it been accomplished? Who are those who claim to have travelled through time? What do scientists think about time travel?    Inspired by the Time Travel theme of Strange Magazine 14 (Fall, 1994) our Strange Web Site Time Travel pages include some of the high points of that issue, as well as some classic time-bending High Strangeness from our Louisiana correspondent Ken Meaux. Ken's haunting piece has been reprinted, retold, and cited many times since it debuted in Strange Magazine 2 (Spring, 1989).Never-before-published material includes Douglas Chapman's quick tour of some time travel movies. Sherrill Roberts discusses the possibility that modern physics may provide some mechanisms for moving though time. Time Travel book reviews and a suggested reading list round out the Time Travel Pages.     HIGH STRANGENESS: TIME TRAVELLER  Ken Meaux's unforgettable telling of a documented incident of possible time-slippage.    QUANTUM STRANGENESS AND SPACETIME  Sherrill Roberts discusses the scientific premises that suggest that time travel may be possible, including proposed mechanisms for warping time. Enter the world of worm holes, black holes, cosmic strings, and time travel paradoxes in this referenced article.    TIME TRAVEL MOVIES  Douglas Chapman touches on some significant time travel films.    TIME TRAVEL BOOK REVIEWS  Marc Davenport's latest book is his take on ufonauts as time travellers: we have met the ETs and they are us. Rick Gregory reviews  Visitors From Time: The Secret of the UFOs and has a few problems with Davenport's conclusions. Ufologist/fortean researcher Jenny Randles explores the mysteries of time in her recent book  Time Travel: Fact, Fiction & Possibility  Douglas Chapman's review is an extended version of the one published in Strange Magazine 14.   MORE TIME TRAVEL BOOKS  A short list of additional time travel books with a popular scientific approach for those with further interest in the subject.    STRANGEhome

    Skip to content          Truth Seeker Forum  Committed to the ongoing research, exploration and enlightened discussion of the paranormal     Scroll down to content          Posts       Posted on  November 27, 2020 November 9, 2020 A Relook at RH – negative Blood Part 1     The below was one of my most popular posts with many comments. The story of mysterious blood sub-type – RH negative. Some researchers including myself feel this blood sub-type is an alien connection – maybe a tracker vector or maybe the humans that possess it are compatible with an alien species.  Enjoy again  There have been some interesting theories about Bloodlines. These theories range from how it can affect the human race to how it can determine your life role and even your status on this planet. As you may know, there are four blood types in the world. O type is the oldest and most common and A-type is second common, B third and AB least common. The Rh factor, which can occur in all blood types, is related in a strange way to the Rhesus primate (monkey).  The majority of the world population has the factor (RH), meaning they are positive. But 15% of the world is negative – lacking the factor completely. At this point, let me mention 33% of the Basque population is Rh-negative. And 55% of the Basque population is Blood type O, which is the highest in the world. The combination puts a lot of O negatives folks in the unique Basque country. I will write more about the Basque people in Part 2  A Blueblood is a term that the Royal European family has been called because many are RH negative and their blood is slightly blue. RH negative blood does not oxidize the way Rh-positive blood does hence the blue color (less oxygen). For many years the UFO community has whispered that Rh-negative humans are quite the prize for the alien groups that have been abducting people around the world over the last hundreds of years or more. I have not seen a conclusive study on this but after talking to several thousand abductees and contactees the Rh-negative folks could be a special targeted group. My guess is that people with this bloodline- factor have abilities that are created and passed down from genetic contact with non-humans. More in future postings –  Sleep Tight, Our blood is our cosmic signature, and it is important to know if you are negative or positive for many reasons.  MWiz.      Posted on  November 20, 2020 November 16, 2020 Dave Paulides Presents- An Alert       In the past, David and I  have done a bit of dueling bingos on my website about the reality of Sasquatch and their possible involvement with missing persons in the wilderness. As time goes by people’s wisdom and knowledge can change or evolve and that is what I believe has happened to David over the years, it happens to us all.   I have followed him for several years, he is a good guy, a great researcher, and an excellent detective. He has asked to spread this important video – so enjoy.  Thanks David, Mike        Posted on  November 13, 2020 November 2, 2020 Dimensional Walking   Rainbow Radaelli, Truth Seeker Forum     Diaries are full of treasures, especially those forgotten over time. As I started to read my diary, page after page revealed a world I let slip by. I’m going to share with you just a snippet of a life and time in the medicine world.  While the Medicine Man ThunderBow wasn’t always easy to understand, he told me how being aware in the waking state affected the dream state, which seemed to make sense. I looked back at my diary and saw that we had called the dream state “dimensional walking.” It knocked my socks off, the very fact I had forgotten this and so many other experiences.   Dimensional walking was introduced to me when I was just 20. At first it seemed like too much discipline, and that was the last thing I wanted to do, especially with just being a few years out of high school. I wanted to spread my wings and be totally free of any kind of discipline. ThunderBow would just smile as I would give excuse after excuse as to why that didn’t appeal to me, but it seemed like he was always a few steps ahead of me, patiently waiting, knowing I would eventually come around.  Something was still coming at me in my dreams. I would wake up scared, sometimes scream or talk in my sleep. He would pat my shoulder and let me know everything was OK. I was safe, and he would mumble a few words in a prayer and usually, this put me at ease and I would fall back asleep. It was nerve-racking, and even as the days were long in the waking state, my nights were just the same. I could feel something out of reach, out of eyesight, and out of my understanding ready to pounce on me.  ThunderBow said that whatever this was knew I was a medicine woman long before I knew or even had an inkling that this path was even a possibility. I always wondered why he would smirk because it was never very funny to me. I would feel as if I was running ahead of myself in my dreams, and as I would catch up to myself, I would see a scary monster. There’s nothing scarier than thinking you are the monster you are running from.  At my wit’s end, I finally decided to follow ThunderBow’s instruction and learn how to do dimensional walking. It seemed quite weird, and I was out of my element at first. Meditation is not my strong suite because my mind is a chatterbox with an endless dialogue to keep itself company. Sometimes there would seem to be multiple whispers going on at once whenever I would try to quiet myself. It was as if they would go on autopilot at the hint of any meditation.  To help me learn how to focus on the “now,” ThunderBow arranged for my first sweat lodge with some friends. He set up a special ceremony for me so that I could understand the importance of discipline and focus. This was key to me being able to confront this monster or the dark entity that wouldn’t leave me alone.   It’s important to note that ThunderBow felt I needed something a bit extreme to kickstart my apprenticeship into dimensional walking. With that being said, the sweat lodge was the start of my medicine path. It was an extreme introduction into a world of the unknown and mysterious realm of shadows and magic … and did I say hot! There’s nothing like feeling like your face is falling off to get your attention. Yes, it was hotter than Hades, and it lasted what felt like an eternity, which was really just over an hour. I crawled in the sweat lodge a bit intimidated, lost and adrift from reality, and crawled out divergent, as if something had breathed new life into me. I was ready to start my tutelage into ThunderBow’s dimensional walking, or so I thought.  Step one was easier than I thought it would be because all I had to do was look for my hands in my dreams. Things changed quickly when I achieved this. Then I had to find large hands or hands wearing gloves or rings, etc. Then came inanimate objects, like bowls or vases that had designs painted on them. And then he upped the ante and asked me to find people in certain clothes and colors. Then I searched for small landscapes and trees. And the hardest of all for me was looking at the sky and finding clouds. I found that I mostly saw color, so ThunderBow said to choose to see in black and white. I didn’t like this because I felt like I would get stuck dreaming in a black-andwhite world. He assured me that I could turn color on just by intending it like a switch.  The good thing about all my exploration was the monster seemed to stay at bay and I was able to focus harder on my research into the realm of dimensional walking. The idea of dimensional walking has everything to do with your conscious awareness as you go to sleep. It’s not just a reminder, but an intention to keep the same awareness in dream time so that the assemblage point (dream body) can move about as if you never went to sleep.  It’s also about being aware of what’s happening to your surroundings as you sleep. Being out of the body and traversing into unknown dimensions was only part of it. I had to be aware of my body back in my bed in my repose position. It was when I was at the two-year mark that something quite terrifying happened that changed everything. I can remember to this day how empowered I felt at first, and then the stark reality hit me of being completely vulnerable and unprepared for the consequences of what I was doing.  ThunderBow said my next goal was to find a movie theater. So I went to bed and focused on finding a movie theater. It took a few weeks, but one night within what seemed minutes of falling asleep, I was sitting in the theater with other people. I felt the seat, heard the music playing in the background, and I smelled popcorn. The movie hadn’t started yet, so I was just sitting by myself staring at a huge white screen. I then remembered to come back to my body, wake up, and then go back to sleep and go right back to my seat in the movie theater. I did it and was elated the next morning.   The following night ThunderBow wanted me to find rocks to walk on and look for a village or small town. I think he suggested somewhere like the English countryside. I thought that would be quite interesting, so I went into my place of quietude and ventured onwards. At first I remembered almost popping into a rocky place and smelling the dirt. It was almost like I was literally in the country. I looked around me, and there were large trees and bushes on a slanting hill.  I was facing a hill full of rocks that seemed easy enough to climb, so I started putting my hands on the rocks and pulling myself up. As I was climbing up the rock incline, I started to feel tingling in my hands and arms. As I reached the top of the rocky hillside, I saw a country house in the distance, and that’s when I got a big whiff of the dirt, flowers, and tiny shrubs up my nose. I felt the wind on my face, and my hair was blowing to the side. It was the first time I had ever felt the wind, and the shock of it and all the smells in my nostrils made me feel dizzy.  I then saw this auroral glimmer go into my hands and up my arms. I felt as if I was coming alive with this wash of scintillating energy, and I knew without a shadow of a doubt that if I didn’t get out of there, I would have fully integrated into the very location I was at. It no longer felt like a dream, but more like an actual place. I remember thinking to myself, is this dimension like back home? When I could feel the cool dirt beneath my hands, I freaked out and pushed away from the rocks. I started to slide down forgetting that I was on a rocky slope, yelling and grabbing for branches to slow my fall.  Then I slowly woke up. I knew something weird had happened because there was a little bit of dirt on my sheets and under my fingernails. This was a first. I realized that what I had done seemed beyond me, and when I told ThunderBow what happened, he seemed pleased but very concerned. We had been working toward something that once attained was a whole other ballgame. He had me take a break from dimensional walking so I could get my bearings back and try again. I never did allow myself after that to go as far into another realm. I held myself back and just couldn’t yield to the dangers of uncharted territory.  I know the rules here in this reality, but to do the dimensional walking I realized that there weren’t any handbooks on what to do if you find yourself lost in another realm. You can’t get cold feet once you are there, and getting back in itself could be a wild ride   Last but not least, I did the one thing I needed to do. Remember the monster hidden in the shadows of my dreams? Well, I confronted it. ThunderBow had me find a mirror, and he said to look into it and tell him what I saw. It took me awhile — I guess because I was avoiding it — but when I finally was able to find a mirror and look into it, I saw a hideous face looking back at me. I started to back away when something weird started to happen. It slowly morphed into my face. And there I was left looking at myself, no monster left insight.  As Medicine Man Black Elk once said, “Sometimes dreams are wiser than waking.” In my case, I had found that I had been afraid of myself and my potential. Philosopher Henri-Frédéric Amiel stated, “Dreams are excursions into the limbo of things, a semi-deliverance from human prison.” It was evident I had freed myself, and I realized that there was so much that dimensional walking could help me figure out and remedy. It was a key to a self-imposed prison. In some ways, I was the prison guard.  Dimensional walking was an insight into the deeper pool of who I really was. I unlearned cultural esthetics that didn’t feel right and had the courage to develop opinions that were solely mine. I also saw that there is so much within myself that is basically uncharted territory. I have continued at a more cautious level with dimensional walking, and I feel it has integrated into my Third Eye sense of awareness.  I haven’t looked into another mirror since that impactful experience. I guess if I have one question today, it would be, what would my reflection look like now? I guess I’ll have to find another mirror and find out.  Rainbow      Posted on  November 6, 2020 October 19, 2020 Protect, Protect, and more Protection    elia-pellegrini — Photo By  I have been doing research in the strange but real world of UFO and the Paranormal for over 50 years, and one thing I have learned is that you need to practice some serious form of self-protection, especially when doing field research. This is because we are dealing with entities like reptilians, ghosts, forest beings, and dark entities of all shapes and forms and they can harm you physically and mentally.  The problem here is since a researcher is going into various powerful beings’ habitat, it is truly best to put some protection around your physical and energetic body. These entities can attach themselves to the unaware researcher and cause havoc after the person leaves the field research area and re-enters his/her home base.  So what can happen if you are not careful and don’t protect yourself? Here are a few examples. First, many of you have heard of Skinwalker Ranch, a powerful vortex in Utah where strange entities come and go through a portal area on the old ranch. The volume of strangeness became so great that the government took it over to watch over this huge vortex. Back before the government took over, a man came out to meditate on the ranch and to make contact with the alien entities, but through this process, his mind was possessed by frightening beings, and that ended his meditation career, and he was never the same. Rainbow and I also went to the Ranch. It seemed like everything was quite normal with the experience. We smudged before and on the way back home but a couple of strange entities followed us to our house. Rainbow being empathic was able to communicate with the two entities, keeping the diabolical one at bay.  Another personal experience I had, was when I was meditating in my home in Georgia, I received a telepathic warning that entities were on their way. The warning led me to believe they were coming for negative purposes so I prepared myself and was ready. Shortly after I received the warning, three reptilian beings came into my meditation and wanted permission to enter my house and possibly do harm to me and/or my family. I confronted them outside my home and they vanished. Confronting them in a fearless way normally will stop their advances.  All of these bad outcomes could have been avoided with a little extra protection. Researchers should simply clear themselves as they leave their homes, doing both, a clearing mantra and smudging. Also before entering a research area, researchers should ask for permission which can either be granted or reject. If permission is rejected, leave immediately.  Finally, if permission is granted and you are leaving the research area you should thank the entities for allowing you to occupy their space. A final protection could be to recite a mantra before the researcher enters his/her home base stating that no entities may enter your sacred place now or ever. It’s quick and it works.  Sleep tight, you always need to protect your mind and soul, because they have infinite cosmic value. To some entities, it’s like winning the lottery, especially if they can invade a human’s inner- self.  MWiz      Posted on  October 30, 2020 October 26, 2020 Werewolf, Wolfman, Dogman – a Cryptid of different names    The Werewolf And The Nineteenth-Century …atmostfear-entertainment.com  Werewolfs and Wolfman have been known around the world since the beginning when man started to pass down stories of them from Scandinavia. England to India, China, Japan, Brazil,  and Russia to name a few areas.  These were scary creatures tall with a wolf-like appearance (with a longer narrower snout than a wolf ), running bi-pedal, with strides four to six feet and more. They are quite a sight, as I will tell you about my personal experience later.  Wolves in Native American vision are magical animals – powerful, very smart, and with a spiritual aura to them. They probably have nothing to do with the Cryptids that have the appearance similarities.  Wolves are magnificent creatures, I have seen them in the wild and one to touch from a wolf sanctuary. It’s a must event on your bucket list. That is why I have them at the top of my web page.  A werewolf and wolfman are the mythical versions of the Dogman. They are mythical because these have a man turning in a wolf or a man part of them and I don’t buy it. Man has always tried to make things scarier, so we embellish for maximum effect.  But Dogman is real, we ( Rainbow and I ) have seen one.  Back several years ago when we lived in New Mexico we were hiking on the east slope of Sandia Mountain outside of Albuquerque.  We parked at the trailhead, Rainbow got out first ( as normal ), and moved toward the trail, I got out and saw a huge bear in front of her and I shouted to watch out. The bear ran and that was that., at least we thought, Then Rainbow noticed a very tall hunched over person gliding across the ridge ahead of us.  I saw it too, but it was  NOT a person – it was an 8 ft plus Dogman.  After catching our breath we decided on a fearless move, follow it.  So we curiously walked toward a situation we were hoping wasn’t a trap. After moving slowly up the trail about 1/2 mile in.  about 150 or so feet away. leaning next to a huge tree there it was very still and watching us. Its body seemed to slowly sway back and forth. Huge head, big eyes, multi-colored hair/fur.  Then suddenly we felt we needed to back off and go back and leave. We think the pushback was from the Dogman.  But we did get a picture as we left -see below.  Dogman – center left of large tree  Sleep tight – Dogman are real – but I sincerely believe they are not dangerous to man as long as one , heeds their warning  MWiz       Posted on  October 23, 2020 October 19, 2020 Strange sounds that go a Bump in the night.    Photo by Leon Rohrwild on Unsplash  I always remember many years ago in Georgia a peer I worked with had an interesting story.  We had been talking for several weeks about Sasquatch up in the north Georgia mountains where I would explore and try to make contact with them.  Shortly after that conversation he had outside wall knocks in the middle of the night in rural  Clayton County,  he first just thought it was a plank, second time no so sure, because he was able to rush outside to see nothing.  The third time he did catch a glimpse of a large brown figure moving toward the woods. Sasquatch maybe, interesting they have an ability to be invisible at times and they may have knocked the first two times and just stand around while my friend just looked around and saw nothing. Wall knocks are quite common in the Sasquatch world, and I have heard several other examples, in my years of research.  Why does Sasquatch do it, well for various reasons I believe, mostly for fun, they watch you race out of your house and look silly? But other times I believe it is a warning,  like maybe mind your own business or stay out of my home territory.  The next two recent stories are from our present home in Oregon. The first one about two weeks ago. I was watching TV at night at the far end of the house and Rainbow was in the other side writing in her office. Suddenly there was a huge shaking of the house and booming sound on Rainbow’s side, I didn’t hear it, but Rainbow was shaken up. She delayed telling me so I would not rush out of the house to check it out, she (being an empath) felt it was of paranormal in origin. I checked the house out in the light of day. There was no damage to the roof or the exterior walls.   Was it a warning?  The next story was last night or early morning – suddenly woken up from a night of deep sleep to hear a crashing sound – like glass without breakage, Rainbow also woke and heard something sliding and falling, but not glass.  In the morning we both looked around and nothing out of place. Rainbow did have a sense something was messy with our stuff and after the things fell they/it quickly picked them up and they vanished -gone.  I guess just another 2020 bump in the night  Sleep tight – a sudden wake – is mostly no fun.  MWiz       Posted on  October 5, 2020 October 4, 2020 The Events of a Century have lined up for a Perfect Storm – and another Super Event – Part 2— The Prep.    This is  part two of last week’s Posting 10/02/20, things to do to survive an EMP event or another super disaster which could happen soon,  Some of these suggestions come from a meeting I had with FEMA during my 2002 Olympic games experience, the meeting was about disaster preparedness. And other suggestions are from research I did over the years on survival training.  Either decide to hunker down in your present residence and or decide on a safe place no more than 1 ½ hours from your residence Dense urban areas are not a good choice during a super disaster – people after 4 or 5 days get very strange especially ones that have not properly prepared and that will be 90 to 95% of the population You will need a reliable safe source of water for 3 months minimal – 1 gal. per person per day minimum. Food 3 months or more – Can/ pouches goods – variety Fish like salmon – fruits, veggies. cooked and no heat needed. (( two manual can openers )) $300 cash per person– if you have coins or bullion take. Meds. daily ones 6 months – First aid kit and safety matches several flashlights, and battery lanterns, and plenty of extra batteries. Always keep your car gas tanks full and if possible 20 or more extra gals of gas, but don’t transport during the crisis – Remember very few Gas stations will have power – probably none. Buy a battery/Crank radio — shortwave, AM and FM model — Weapons – if you are a non-gun person – a couple of baseball bats will come in handy.  The above list is for the basics and I am sure there are a few other items  you will want to have, But remember, you will have only 15 minutes to load your car and start your trip to your safe place , that is it, it’s critical to be on the road quickly before the rest of the world wakes up to this disaster. Now you will want  to load your car – as soon as you realize there is a total regional black-out( with no logical reason) also with no cell coverage.  Next is your car hardened from the EMP blast?– here are two sites that discuss that  https://www.backdoorsurvival.com/how-to-emp-proof-your-car-even-if-you-dont-really-have-to/   Is It Possible to Make Your Car EMP Proof?   And there are more sites with helpful information. I have heard for some models and depending how close you are to the blast, by just disconnecting the battery and reconnecting does the trick .  I hope none of the above is necessary ever – but I still say it’s 50/50 – and as I am writing this -the President just contacted COVID – another destabilizing moment – it doesn’t seem to stop.  Sleep tight. And be prepared.  MWiz      Posted on  October 2, 2020 September 27, 2020 The Events of a Century have lined up for a Perfect Storm – and another Super Event    Photo by Science in HD on Unsplash  So here we go – so here goes America – Democracy is a wonderful way to govern people because, in theory, they are governing themselves but its downfall, is that it is fragile and relies upon people doing the right thing and making sound decisions, based on truths. And the truth is hard to come by these days.  With that said, let me continue – we as you all know by now are suffering a 100-year Pandemic, a President that has pushed our Constitution to its limits, racial civil unrest as intense as any time in American history, natural climate disasters like never before, and last but not least a national election like no other in American History, that could tear us apart like the Civil War.  And we have foreign enemies that know very well know how to use propaganda to further weaken our country. We are in a weakened state, no doubt in my mind. Our enemies have never had a better chance to physically attack and seriously damage our democracy.  So here is what I think, there is another Super event coming  —  when is it coming? at our lowest point of total stress – which I believe is the time frame of now through after the election until someone concedes it and victory for them is agreed upon on a national level.  The Super event is a terrorist like attack from one or two countries in the form of an EMP – Electromagnetic Pulse on a nationwide level, which will freeze/destroy all things electronic and the repair will take months even years, totally destroying our economy and our democracy as we know it.  I know this is grim and I sincerely hope I am totally wrong, but thinking about it long and hard I believe its probably a (50-50) chance of happening, because our enemies know this opportunity won’t again happen in their lifetimes – they must strike soon.  Sleep tight — in a few days, I will give some suggestions on how to have a chance to survive.  And many people will survive.  MWiz      Posted on  September 25, 2020 September 21, 2020 Covid-19 – Vaccine – Transhumanism    Photo by Icons8 Team on Unsplash  Covid-19 is a multi-dimensional being, which in my estimation is delivering messages to our RNA and our DNA.  But I am not sure yet, are these messages good or bad, are they strictly changes or are they enhancements? The virus has this amazing ability to get into our cells and muck with them. And most of the time we are just a pass-through vehicle with no change or no harm done.  That brings us to transhumanism, the melding of human bio with other non-human bio or even AI. So Covid-19 could be a vector to start the trans-human process- make us into this new being. or new species, or Human 2.0.  Now the vaccine, I must start this off with a disclaimer statement I am not a fan of vaccines. But I acknowledge their success in conquering some very bad diseases, polio, yellow fever, smallpox, and a few others, but our drug companies have in the last 20 years changed the definition of the word vaccine – to the “goose that lays the golden eggs”, trying to vax us for everything and its beating up our bodies and weakening our own immune system.  So the Covid19 vax race is on and a new player has surfaced the mRNA vaccine, where particles similar to the real virus are injected into you and making your body create synthetic genes and they in theory provide the body with a safe target to create immunity. Also maybe not a good thing, those Synthetic genes can be patented by the drug company and strangely enough those synthetic genes become part you and owned by the drug company. Go figure. And as we are going warp speed to create these vaccines with Synterinc genes  – we have no idea what the long term effect on the human genome will be.  Sleep tight – 2020 will be over in less than 100 days , but will we have survived ?  MWiz       Posted on  September 19, 2020 August 9, 2020 Coming Home to Egypt    The Unexpected Adventure   My adventure to Egypt changed my life forever. Sometimes lessons are learned when we least expect them or when we aren’t looking for them at all. With this being said, this is my story of the unexpected adventure that turned my life topsy turvy into the realm of the Priestess.  Egypt is the mysterious Mistress of magic and ancient knowledge. She’s the elixir of times not forgotten but kept secret behind closed doors surrounded by sand and desert. Moments in our lives come and go but the memories linger on beyond our lifetime into the next, just as the sands in an hourglass turn over and over again.  I realized the moment I stepped foot on Egypt’s ancient sands, I had truly for the first time in my life, come home. The Priestess in me awakened to the sounds of morning prayer and the belly dancer’s drums, summoning a night of dance. My soul shouted in delight and my spiritual quest began with a vengeance that was foreign and scary all at the same time. It was the first time I was in the presence of Source , the old ways, or as some call them, the Ancient Aliens.  As a dancer, yes, I was in my element but as a Medicine Woman, in some ways, I was in way over my head. Let me explain.  Before I ventured to Cairo, Egypt in 1991, I was told by two of my mentors that Egypt could be dangerous for me because I was open, meaning I was already learning the old ways of ceremony and prayer. As a young Medicine Woman, there were things I was already experiencing that were a bit dark so my teachers stressed that I rethink my plans. The 28-year-old in me didn’t listen and to this day I am forever grateful to her that she didn’t but that doesn’t mean they weren’t right.  My ex-husband, a medicine man named Thunder Bow gave me an amulet to wear to keep me safe and a friend made me a small hand made knife that I hid in my boot in case I needed to protect myself. But how does one protect themselves from an archaic and highly intelligent Source that has been around since the beginning of time? I sensed “them” before I stepped aboard my plane and they made their presence known in subtle ways such as nonsensical dreams and knots in my stomach that seemed to never go away.  My trip started out as a belly dancer’s dream but in actuality, it was a coming home to my Priestess roots.  I didn’t know beforehand that I had been a Priestess many lifetimes in Egypt. Past life memories came back to me in vivid dreams, vibrant and emotionally riveting. They came non-stop, a young girl of 14 or a boy of 10 at first. Then my memories flashed and changed to me being a woman of high importance, priestesses surrounding me in the moonlight and a ceremony being performed to the Goddess Isis. Some of the past lives were in interesting times, such as the upheaval of Akhenaten’s priests fighting with soldiers and overtaking the inner sanctum of one of the pyramids. The vengeance of the old Gods was terrifying!  I had a flashback of Tutankhamen coming to Luxor for the Sham el Nessim celebration. I was shocked and in awe as these memories flooded into my waking state. It was as if I never left.  I was remembering so much so that I sensed someone or something was not happy that my memories were coming back. Throughout the many months I was in Egypt, 2 attempts were made on my life and the third and last attempt which happened back in New Mexico, almost succeeded.  Double Trouble  The first attempt happened one morning when I was visiting an indoor market underneath an apartment complex. It was probably 20 stories high in a crowded area by Maadi a suburb of Cairo. I had walked in for some groceries and when I bought all I needed, I walked back out into the street. Within seconds, a woman suddenly yelled at me in English, “Watch out!”  An area rug about 10 feet long came crashing down, barely missing me by a few feet. If I hadn’t jumped back, I don’t think I would be telling this story. My legs became weak and I felt as if they were going to collapse under me. I was in utter shock when people came running over to me from all directions. Everyone was asking me if I was okay while I looked up, seeing multiple balconies but no sign of where the rug came from. I pushed my way through the crowd and walked away with shaky legs and somewhere inside of me, I sensed that was a warning.  Later that day in the afternoon, I was walking down a street by the little apartment I rented. I was weary but had calmed myself down from the morning’s close call.  The butterflies in my stomach had just left me and I was feeling more assured that it was just a coincidence when all of a sudden, a white van full of people came rushing up behind me and hit me from my left side. My left elbow saved my life because it made me bounce off the van. If I hadn’t bounced off the van, I would have been knocked under it and it’s back wheel would have run me over.  It all happened so fast, seemingly in a split second, within a blink of an eye.  I yelled at the driver who stopped the van and again people came running towards me to see if I was okay. I looked at the driver and yelled, “Majnoon!” which means crazy in Arabic. The driver had a strange look on his face as he tried to calm me and the crowd down. People were yelling at him and I realized that if I didn’t leave it would have turned into a chaotic scene. I left the crowd, went to my apartment and realized something was either trying to kill me or get my attention.  The bruise on my arm was only the beginning.   Paralysis  The nights were alive with magical scents such as jasmine and other flowering smells that will forever stay with me. But within all of this enchantment there was always a reminder that this is where time truly began, and if I forgot to remember where I was, the ominous silent night constantly reminded me that there were hidden eyes watching … always.  I awoke one night with startled and panicky breathing, like I had been running in my sleep. I was on my stomach with my head turned which wasn’t my normal position because I’m a side sleeper. I realized immediately that I was completely paralyzed accept for my eyes. I was panning the room trying to figure out what to do. I felt pressure on my lower back as if something was holding me down. I tried to turn around but to no avail. I thought I had come down with some weird disease and I started to panic and perspire from my adrenaline and fear kicking in. I was literally wet from head to toe like I had just stepped out of a shower.  I remembered, Thunder Bow teaching me how to focus so I could calm my mind. I knew it was just a matter of remembering where my inner sanctuary was, so I closed my eyes and tried to push off whatever was holding me down. It felt like an eternity but in reality, it was only 10 minutes or a little more to fixate on my 3rd Eye. When I was able to calm myself down, I felt the pressure on my lower back instantly disappear and I turned over literally overcome with relief, and within seconds, I jumped out of bed. I looked all around the room trying to figure out what had just happened and what could have possibly held me down.  I had a hard time going back to sleep but slowly I drifted off and awoke the next morning sore all over, especially in my lower back. I got up and checked my lower back in the mirror and saw about 5 or 6 small brown circles, like burn marks on me scattered around within a 6-inch area. They didn’t hurt at all and within 2 or 3 days, they were gone.  Missing Time  I became friends with a guy I’ll call Jimbo. We were hanging out at a club called Club Thirteen. Out of the blue, Jimbo asked me if I wanted to climb one of the Queen’s Pyramids. Now, it’s forbidden so I don’t recommend anyone doing it but at that time in the early 90’s, they didn’t have as much security around the pyramids as they do now. It was around 12:30 am so I was intrigued and said yes. We hailed a taxi and within 30 minutes we were in an area just below the Queens Pyramids. We got off in this location so we could go in a back way where we wouldn’t be seen. We walked by old burial chambers dug in the side of rocks of the workers who supposedly built the pyramids or so the story goes. It was eerie and I could almost hear them whispering to us, asking us what we were doing there.  Once we walked past the burial chambers which took about 20 or 30 minutes, we found ourselves at the foot of one of the Queen’s Pyramids. I can’t remember which one but it was at night and I was a willing participant partially because I knew it was taboo.  Jimbo asked me if I was sure I wanted to climb up and I said, “Absolutely!”  We started our climb and within a short time, we were at the top. I remember clearly the mosquitos, millions or should I say billions of them buzzing around us! I mentioned to Jimbo that I just couldn’t take the mosquitos anymore when all of a sudden, puff, we were gone and then back again! It was like a time glitch had just happened. When we came to, and it was around 6 am because we could hear the morning prayer on all the loudspeakers throughout Cairo. It was eerie to “wake up” to that sound and realize that we had been up there for a long time, at least 2 to 3 hours with no memory of what happened. Interestingly enough, I had no mosquito bites on me at all!  We climbed down the pyramid freaking out that we would be discovered and made a mad dash back towards the small village. We hailed a cab and went to get coffee and breakfast. I was a chatty Kathy and Jimbo was silent and moody. No matter how much I prodded him, he wouldn’t talk about what had just happened to us and after that incident, he never wanted to go out or do anything with me again.  Was the paralysis and the missing time connected? I can’t be certain but I have come to realize that with magic and mystery, nothing is a coincidence.  The third attempt on my life happened when I came home.  Uninvited Guest  I’m 5’3, but at that time, I weighed only a hundred pounds when I finally arrived home and my feet touched the New Mexico ground.  I was exhausted and tired beyond belief. Interestingly, I ate like a horse and never felt full. I ate as carefully as I could in Egypt so I didn’t venture out into the odd and weird world of exotic foods. I know what you may be thinking, parasites and that was exactly what my family and me thought too but when I went to the doctor, he tested me for a variety of parasites, but didn’t find anything.  I was slowly dying and my ex-husband knew it. He saw a dark, black mass attached to me from my upper right shoulder. I felt off balance and I was walking as if I had injured my back.  Thunder Bow took  me to another medicine man named Thomas One Wolf. When I went to meet with him, he sensed that something came back home with me. He told me I had to do a Vision Quest and with his help, he would take care of the “uninvited guest.”  I made sacred tobacco pouches, praying and asking for help as I made each one of them, connecting them together making a circle with twine. They closed me off to the outside world during my Vision Quest so that I could find answers and “see” what this thing was. Three days and three nights became a blur. I mostly remember that I laid in the sun during the day and crawled into my tent at night. I knew instinctively that the sun was going to help heal me. I could feel it’s warmth and somehow I felt its rays go into me, pulsing, targeting this dark mass attached to me. Thomas One Wolf, came and went as if he was a dream, praying and doing ceremony, asking the Ancestors to help.  The moment the entity let go of me, I felt as if a ton of bricks had been lifted off of me. I felt light as a feather, light headed and I had to learn to rebalance myself so that I could realign my back and straighten it out. I was no longer hunched back, carrying a weight that was not mine.  Thomas One Wolf said I had only a few months to live when I came to him and that this thing was feeding off my life force. He said it knew I was a medicine woman in this life and that it saw my  past lives in Egypt. It was connected to the Djinn and I was lucky I remembered to go to the sun God Ra to help me get rid of it.  The priestess in me came alive and helped me heal and it was with this remembering that my greatest lesson was learned. I brought the memories back to New Mexico with me and with the help of Thomas One Wolf was able to get rid of the attachment.  Egypt is a portal to other worlds that have been apart of our world for a millennium.  Did the Ancient Aliens take me somewhere during my lost time on top of the pyramid? How did that black mass find me? Even today, I know something was altered in me during that lost time.  Most importantly, and probably the greatest gift of all, is the fact that all those past lives in Egypt are alive and in me and they are apart of the medicine woman that I am today. Magic is real and when you become apart of it, it lives on in you, reminding you, you are so much more than you think you are. It’s going to sound cliche but to boldly go where no man or woman has gone before, one only has to go to Egypt. There’s no place like home no matter how many life times we live.
